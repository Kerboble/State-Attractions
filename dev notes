-I have decided to make a travel app that provides the top 10 attractions in every state of America. I made a rough sketch of what the homepage will look like and found an SVG from https://simplemaps.com/resources/svg-us that I am going to be using.

-Extrapolated on the theme of my main page and subsequent pages of each state. Made an outline of the main page and the subsequent pages on figma. I also started to work on some template html, and css.

-Made the objects for each of the states so that I can loop through them and display them in the html/css template I have created. This also allows me to open their paths when they are clicked on.

-Completed 25 of the states and their attractions. Each state has their own html and js file. Within the JS file I created an object literal that contains the state's name, a photo of the location, a description, location within the state and a link to more information on the location.

-Made code more dry and fixed some bugs involving some states and their interactiveness. Ended up missing a state so I had to finish that up. Went over the code and made comments so anyone looking at the code does not have to guess what's going on.
